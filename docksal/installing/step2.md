Now that Docksal has been installed. Now let's take a moment to start interacting with the commands.

To get started we will use the `fin` command and interact using different subcommands.

To get a list of all available subcommands run the following `fin help`{{execute HOST1}}.

Some popular commands are:

* `fin project create`{{execute HOST1}} which is used for creating new projects using an example template.
* `fin docker`{{execute HOST1}} which is used for interacting with Docker directly.

For some additional projects like Drupal and WordPress the following commands can be used.

* `fin wp` to use WP CLI for Wordpress projects.
* `fin drush` to use Drush for Drupal projects.
* `fin drupal` to use Drupal Console for a Drupal 8 project.
